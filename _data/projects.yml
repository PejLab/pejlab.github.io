- name: aFC-n
  description: aFC-n is a multi-eQTL generalization of the allelic fold change (aFC) method for estimating regulatory effect sizes. We provide effect size estimates for GTEx tissues in a Zenodo repository.

- name: ANEVA
  description: ANEVA (analysis of expression variation) quantifies genetic variation in gene dosage from allelic expression (AE) data in a population. ANEVA-DOT applies these variance estimates in a dosage outlier test for use in rare disease diagnostic pipelines.

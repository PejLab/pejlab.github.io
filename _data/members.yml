  bio: >-
    Robert joined the lab as a postdoc in 2021. He is interested in developing
    and applying computational methods for uncovering novel biological insights
    from genomic and transcriptomic data. Prior to joining the lab, he worked
    on developing and applying nonlinear dynamic and statistical models for
    understanding cellular response variability observed in single-cell
    measurements and in binary classification tasks. He holds a Ph.D. in
    Physiology, Biophysics, and Systems Biology from the Weill Cornell Graduate
    School of Medical Sciences and completed postdoctoral work at IBM Research
    and the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai.

- name: Mehdi Esmaeili-Fard
  title: Postdoc

  bio: >-
    Mehdi joined the lab in 2023. He is a computational and quantitative
    biologist and applies statistical methods to detect genomic variations
    underlying disease/traits. Mehdi also has wide experience in whole-genome
    prediction using statistical approaches. At the PejLab, Mehdi's work
    focuses on applying bioinformatics and computational methods to conduct
    GWAS and eQTL/single-cell eQTL analyses to identify genes and pathways in
    the cochlear-vestibular system related to balance in older adults. Mehdi is
    interested in multi-omics analyses using different layers of genomic data
    that can lead to a better connection between genotype and phenotype and a
    better systematic understanding of the information flow across different
    omics layers. "By the way, our ultimate goal is improving human health :)".

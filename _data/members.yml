    Mehdi joined the lab in 2023. He is a computational and quantitative
    biologist and applies statistical methods to detect genomic variations
    underlying disease/traits. Mehdi also has wide experience in whole-genome
    prediction using statistical approaches. At the PejLab, Mehdi's work
    focuses on applying bioinformatics and computational methods to conduct
    GWAS and eQTL/single-cell eQTL analyses to identify genes and pathways in
    the cochlear-vestibular system related to balance in older adults. Mehdi is
    interested in multi-omics analyses using different layers of genomic data
    that can lead to a better connection between genotype and phenotype and a
    better systematic understanding of the information flow across different
    omics layers. "By the way, our ultimate goal is improving human health :)".

  bio: >-
    Robert joined the lab as a postdoc in 2021. He is interested in developing
    and applying computational methods for uncovering novel biological insights
    from genomic and transcriptomic data. Prior to joining the lab, he worked
    on developing and applying nonlinear dynamic and statistical models for
    understanding cellular response variability observed in single-cell
    measurements and in binary classification tasks. He holds a Ph.D. in
    Physiology, Biophysics, and Systems Biology from the Weill Cornell Graduate
    School of Medical Sciences and completed postdoctoral work at IBM Research
    and the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai.

  bio: >-
    Yan joined the lab as a staff scientist in 2024, focusing on the application
    of statistical machine learning models to analyze single-cell spatial
    transcriptomics and genomics within clinical trial datasets. Prior to this
    role, she concentrated her research on functional genomics, aiming to
    discover new drug targets for neurological disorders, immune diseases, and
    cancers. Yan holds a PhD in Cellular Biology from the University of Michigan
    and a Master's degree in Computer Science from Georgia Tech. Her
    postdoctoral work was conducted at AbbVie.

- name: Mehdi Esmaeili-Fard
  title: Postdoc

  bio: >-
    Mehdi joined the lab in 2023. He is a computational and quantitative
    biologist and applies statistical methods to detect genomic variations
    underlying disease/traits. Mehdi also has wide experience in whole-genome
    prediction using statistical approaches. At the PejLab, Mehdi's work
    focuses on applying bioinformatics and computational methods to conduct
    GWAS and eQTL/single-cell eQTL analyses to identify genes and pathways in
    the cochlear-vestibular system related to balance in older adults. Mehdi is
    interested in multi-omics analyses using different layers of genomic data
    that can lead to a better connection between genotype and phenotype and a
    better systematic understanding of the information flow across different
    omics layers. "By the way, our ultimate goal is improving human health :)".

  bio: >-
    Mehreen joined the group in 2024. She is a population geneticist interested
    in understanding human adaptation and evolutionary history. She is working
    on developing methods to understand the relationship between ancestry and
    gene expression. Her previous work involved developing statistical methods
    for analyzing human genome data, particularly in identifying and
    differentiation among different evolutionary forces including positive
    selection and adaptive introgression. She has a PhD in Bioinformatics and
    Genomics from Penn State and did her postdoc at Cold Spring Harbor Labs.

    Kaushik joined the lab in 2021 and is a second-year graduate student. His
    thesis project involves developing methods for rare variant outlier
    detection. He is interested in using data science to help improve human
    health. Before joining Scripps, he co-founded and led GeoACT, a project to
    model COVID-19 spread in schools working at the San Diego Supercomputer
    Center with Dr. Ilya Zaslavsky. Kaushik holds a B.S. in Data Science from
    the Halicioglu Data Science Institute, UC San Diego.

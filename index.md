# Genomic Data Modeling

We have moved to the [Seattle Children's Research Institute](https://www.seattlechildrens.org/research/research-institute/) as of May 1st, 2023 where we are a part of the [University of Washington School of Medicine](https://www.uwmedicine.org/school-of-medicine), and the department of [Genome Sciences](https://www.gs.washington.edu/). We are hiring at all levels.

We are interested in the design of probabilistic machine learning methods and statistical models that incorporate known biochemical principles to facilitate decision-making from limited data and to allow for asking smarter questions. We have a major focus on quantitative analysis of regulatory variation in the human genome from large scale functional genomics data and its application to rare diseases and precision medicine.

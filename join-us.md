<div class="emphasis-box">We're excited to hear from you!</div>

We have recently transitioned from Scripps Research to the Seattle Childrenâ€™s Research Institute and the University of Washington in Seattle. We hire at all levels from interns to postdocs and staff scientists. If you are interested in working with us, send your resume to pejmanm@uw.edu 

If you are interested in doing your graduate work in our group, you have to first be accepted to a graduate program in UW. UW has several related graduate programs. We are currently in the process of joining the [Seattle-MCB](https://mcb-seattle.edu/) and the [UW Genome Sciences](https://www.gs.washington.edu/academics/gradprogram/index.htm) graduate programs. Please feel free to reach out before applying.

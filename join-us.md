<div class="emphasis-box">We're excited to hear from you!</div>

We are transitioning from Scripps Research to the Seattle Children’s Research Institute and the University of Washington in Seattle. If you are interested in working with us, send your resume to pejmanm AT uw DOT edu. We hire at all levels from interns to postdocs and staff scientists.

If you are interested in doing your graduate work in our group, you have to first be accepted to a graduate program in UW. UW has several related graduate programs. We are currently in the process of joining the [Seattle-MCB](https://mcb-seattle.edu/) and the [UW Genome Sciences](https://www.gs.washington.edu/academics/gradprogram/index.htm) graduate programs. Please feel free to reach out before applying.

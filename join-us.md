<div class="emphasis-box">We're excited to hear from you!</div>

We have recently transitioned from Scripps Research to the Seattle Children’s Research Institute and the University of Washington in Seattle. We hire at all levels from interns to postdocs and staff scientists. If you are interested in working with us, send your resume to pejmanm@uw.edu 

If you are interested in doing your graduate work in our group, you have to first be accepted to a graduate program in UW. UW has several related graduate programs. We are currently in the process of joining the [Seattle-MCB](https://mcb-seattle.edu/) and the [UW Genome Sciences](https://www.gs.washington.edu/academics/gradprogram/index.htm) graduate programs. Please feel free to reach out before applying.

### Postdoctoral Research Associate / Staff Scientist position at the Genomic Data Modeling lab.

The Genomic Data Modeling lab at [Seattle Children’s Research Institute](https://www.seattlechildrens.org/research/centers-programs/), led by Dr. Mohammadi, seeks highly motivated Postdoctoral research associates or Staff Scientists to join ongoing projects. Our research is at the interface of Machine Learning and Statistical Genetics. We are affiliated with the [University of Washington](https://www.washington.edu/) School of Medicine and the Department of [Genome Sciences](https://www.gs.washington.edu/). 

We use a statistical machine learning approach to address problems in biomedical research, including modeling variation in the non-coding genome, identifying genetic variation that contributes to disease, and analyzing multi-omics data. We develop and apply mathematical frameworks, probabilistic models, and deep learning to address the computational challenges of analyzing genome variation and its effect on human health. We participate in basic research as part of large functional genomics consortia and collaborate closely with medical doctors in the clinic to ensure translational impact.

For more information, visit our lab website: [https://pejlab.org](https://pejlab.org) or contact Dr. Mohammadi directly via email: [pejmanm@uw.edu](mailto:pejmanm@uw.edu)

We seek candidates to develop new statistical models and/or apply analysis pipelines to large genomic data, including short/long-read sequencing data from bulk samples and single cells. Thus, experience in any of the following areas is of interest: genomics, Statistical Genetics, sequencing data analysis, Bioinformatics, Machine Learning, Probabilistic Modeling, Statistics, Computer Science, and Optimization. We have a range of projects that can fit different backgrounds, but <u>extensive scientific programming experience is necessary for all candidates</u>. 

#### Requirements

- Doctorate (PhD/MD) or comparable research experience in Genetics, Genomics, Bioinformatics, Computer Science, Physics, or a closely related field.
- Solid scientific programming experience.
- Peer-reviewed scientific publications as lead author.

#### Preferred (required for staff scientists)

- Substantial prior experience in population genomics.
- Strong background in data analysis or modeling.
- Experience with sequencing data analysis.

#### Salary Range

The base salary is $65,000 to $120,000 per year, based on experience and excellence. The position will have a standard benefits package that includes employer-sponsored retirement contributions (401k) and health insurance, among other things.
